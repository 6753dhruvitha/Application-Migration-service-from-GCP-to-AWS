PROJECTIVE OBJECTIVE



In this project, I am working on migrating an application environment from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application includes virtual machines, storage, databases, and network configurations.

The migration involves:

• Identifying and analyzing all the components currently hosted on GCP

• Mapping GCP services (like Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage) to equivalent AWS services (like EC2, RDS, S3)

• Re-creating or transferring the infrastructure in AWS using tools like AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), and manual setup when needed

• Testing application performance, stability, and compatibility in the AWS environment

• Ensuring data integrity, network configuration, and security policies are properly set up in AWS

• Finalizing the cutover and decommissioning GCP resources


PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT


• The purpose of this project is to help :

•••> Reduce cloud costs or take advantage of AWS's pricing structure or credits

•••> Improve service availability, performance, or flexibility by moving to AWS

•••> Centralize infrastructure if other systems already run on AWS

•••> Align with long-term cloud strategy or vendor preference

• From a learning and professional point of view, this project helps me:

•••> Get hands-on experience with real-world cloud migration challenges

•••> Learn how to work with both GCP and AWS in depth

•••> Understand the importance of cloud architecture planning, security, and cost management

•••> Improve my skills in using migration tools, cloud automation, and performance testing
